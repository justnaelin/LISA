| init var x  | declare and initialize variable with value x |
| put var1 var2 | set the value of var1 to the value of var2 |
| input       | take console input and store in register |
| output var  | print value of var to console | 
| store var   | set the value of var to the value of the register |
| plus var1 var2 | collect the sum of var1 and var2 in the register |
| minus var1 var2 | subtract var2 from var1 and store value in register |
| erase       | clear the register |
| if          | evaluates condition |
